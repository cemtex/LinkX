<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The General Settings interface allows you to configure the software options as you like.  There are a number of settings that you can adjust, and each of them 
is described in this section of the manual.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Basic Settings</b>

<ul>
<b>Base URL</b> - This is the URL that points to the directory where LinkX is installed.  If you install LinkX in the base directory of your
site this would be http://www.yoursite.com

<b>Cookie Domain</b> - This is the domain name of the site where LinkX is installed, for use in setting cookies<br /><br />


<b>E-mail Address</b> - This is the e-mail address that will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by LinkX<br /><br />

<b>E-mail Name</b> - This is the name that will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by LinkX<br /><br />

<b>E-mail Sender</b> - Choose the method that LinkX will use for sending emails.  In most cases you should leave this set to the default PHP mail() Function
option.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>PHP mail() Function</b> - LinkX will use PHP's built in mail() function for sending e-mail messages.<br />
<b>Sendmail</b> - LinkX will use sendmail on your server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that PHP is not running
in safe mode and the popen() function is not disabled.  You will need to enter the full path to sendmail in the text input box
after the drop down selection field.<br />
<b>SMTP Server</b> - LinkX will use a SMTP server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that the SMTP server has authorized your
server to send e-mail messages through it.  You will need to enter the hostname of the SMTP server in the input box after the drop
down selection field.
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<b>New Links Page</b> - The name you want to use for the page that will display the newest links.  If you are using mod_rewrite to create
search engine friendly URLs, this page name will appear directly in the URL.  If you are not using mod_rewrite, this page name will appear
in the index.php query string.<br /><br />

<b>Popular Links Page</b> - The name you want to use for the page that will display the most clicked links.  If you are using mod_rewrite to create
search engine friendly URLs, this page name will appear directly in the URL.  If you are not using mod_rewrite, this page name will appear
in the index.php query string.<br /><br />

<b>Top Links Page</b> - The name you want to use for the page that will display the top rated links.  If you are using mod_rewrite to create
search engine friendly URLs, this page name will appear directly in the URL.  If you are not using mod_rewrite, this page name will appear
in the index.php query string.<br /><br />

<b>Link Details Page</b> - The name you want to use for the page that will display the link details.  You must place a %d somewhere in this page name, which will
be replaced by the link ID number dynamically by LinkX. This value is only used when you have mod_rewrite enabled for search engine friendly URLs<br /><br />

<b>File Extension</b> - The file extension to use for link pages. This value is only used when you have mod_rewrite enabled for search engine friendly URLs<br /><br />

<b>Date Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for date values<br /><br />

<b>Time Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for date values<br /><br />

<b>Timezone</b> - Select the timezone you are located in so that dates and times can be calculated properly<br /><br />

<b>Decimal Point</b> - The value to use for the decimal point in numbers<br /><br />

<b>Thousands Separator</b> - The value to use for the thousands separator in numbers<br /><br />

<b>Use mod_rewrite to create search engine friendly URLs</b> - If your server has the mod_rewrite Apache module enabled, you can check this box if you
want search engine friendly URLs to be used.<br /><br />


<b>Using custom templates for category pages</b> - Check this box if you have configured a custom template name for any of your categories.  Using custom
category templates will require additional database queries, so this is only recommended if you absolutely need it and cannot create a custom template
using the already available template commands.

<br />
<br />

dsbl.org (Distributed Sender Blackhole List) provides a service where you can find if certain IP addresses have been blocked because they are known to be
on open proxy, e-mail relay, or other compromised computer.  Many times these IP addresses represent computers that have been hacked and are being controlled
by spammers to allow them to make HTTP requests from many different IP addresses.  Enabling any of these options will cause LinkX to check against the dsbl.org
list when the specified action is taking place, and will block the user from completing that action if their IP address is on the list.

<ul>
<b>Check dsbl.org for banned IP addresses during link submission</b><br />
