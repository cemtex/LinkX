<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The account search function in LinkX allows you to quickly locate accounts so they can be approved, edited, deleted, etc.  This document provides an overview of the account search
interface.


<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Searching User Accounts</b>

<br />
<br />

To access the account search interface use the Accounts &gt; Search Accounts function from the control panel menu.  This will load a page which will initially indicate
that no search term has been entered.  To start your search, enter the term you would like to search for in the text input box and select the field that you would like to search in.
Each of the search fields is described below.

how the accounts are sorted by selecting the sorting field from the drop down list.  The available sorting fields correspond with the search fields which are 
described above.  Once you have the search values filled in how you want them, press the search button to display the links that meet your criteria.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Account Functions</b>

<br />
<br />

You will be able to run a number of different functions on the accounts that are displayed.  To display additional information about an account,
click on the <img src="../images/go-down.png" width="11" height="10" border="0" alt=""> icon.  This will send a request to your server for the information,
so it may take a couple of seconds to load.  Once it has been loaded, the information will slide into view.

<br />
<br />

Clicking on the icons in the Functions column of the table will allow you to run that function on a single account.  You can also check the boxes next to
multiple accounts to perform the functions listed at the bottom of the page.  The single account function icons are each described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
