With LinkX you can create custom rejection e-mail messages that will be sent to link or account submitters that you have rejected.  For each link or account that you
reject, you will be able to select which custom rejection e-mail you want to send.  This document will provide information on creating and maintaining rejection e-mails.

<b class="heading">Viewing/Searching Rejection E-mails<a name="search"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To view or search your currently configured rejection e-mails, access the Templates &gt; Rejection E-mails function from the control panel menu.  This will display a page where you will be able to 
see the currently configured rejection e-mails and search them if you wish.

<br />
<br />

In the table that displays the rejection e-mails, you will find a couple of functions that you can run on a single rejection e-mail.  Each of those functions are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/edit.png" width="9" height="12" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to edit the rejection e-mail.  A window will appear where you will be able to edit all of it's settings.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">

</td>
<td>
Click this icon to delete the rejection e-mail.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

In addition to running these functions on single rejection e-mails, you can also run the delete function on multiple rejection e-mails at once.  To run the delete function, put a check in the checkbox next to the
rejection e-mails you want to delete, then press the Delete button at the bottom of the page.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Adding a Rejection E-mail</b>

<br />
<br />

To add a new rejection e-mail access the Templates &gt; Rejection E-mails function from the control panel menu.  This will display your currently configured rejection e-mail.  Near the top of the page in the header
bar that reads "Rejection E-mails" click on the <img src="../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt=""> icon.  This will display a popup window where you will be able to enter the data
for the new rejection e-mail that you want to add.  Each of the form fields are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Identifier</b>
</td>
<td>
Enter a short identifier for this rejection e-mail.  These identifiers will appear when you are selecting which rejection e-mail to send to a user.  Keep 
in mind that these rejection e-mails will be shown for both links and user accounts, so you may want to indicate the type of rejection e-mail in the identifier.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Subject</b>
</td>
<td>
The full subject of the rejection e-mail message
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Text Body</b>
</td>
<td>
The text body of the rejection e-mail message.  This message will be displayed for users that have text-only e-mail readers.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap>
<b>HTML Body</b>
</td>
<td>
The HTML body of the rejection e-mail message.  This message will be displayed for users that have HTML capable e-mail readers.<br />
TIP: Click on the <img src="../images/html.png" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt=""> icon to automatically convert the text
body to HTML format.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

Once you have filled in all of the fields as you want them, press the Add Rejection E-mail button.  This will add the new e-mail to the database, and it will
be immediately available for use as a rejection e-mail message.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Rejection E-mail Template Values</b>

<br />
<br />

The template values that are valid for your rejection e-mails depend on what type of item you are processing.  When you are adding rejection e-mails it is recommended
that you create separate e-mails for account and link rejections, and label each according to their type in the Identifier field so you don't accidentally send an account
rejection message when you reject a link.  The template values available are:

<ul>
<li> If you are rejecting a link, the template values for the email-link-added.tpl template are valid
<li> If you are rejecting a user account, the template values for the email-account-added.tpl template are valid
</ul>

You can find details of the template values that are valid in these templates by viewing the <a href="email-templates.html">E-mail Templates</a> section of this manual.
