When you use the install.php script you will be prompted to enter your MySQL database information.  Each of those fields are described below.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>Username</b> - This is the username you use to access the MySQL database server.  If you do not know your MySQL username, contact
your server administrator to get that information.<br /><br />
<b>Password</b> - This is the password you use to access the MySQL database server.  If you do not know your MySQL password, contact
your server administrator to get that information.<br /><br />
<b>Database</b> - This is the name of the database that you want the software to use.  Note that this name cannot just be made up.  A
database with this name must exist, and the username and password you enter must be allowed to access it.  If you do not know the name
of a database you can use, contact your server administrator and have them create one for you.<br /><br />
<b>Hostname</b> - This is the hostname of the server where the MySQL database server is running.  In most cases you do not need to change
this from localhost.  If you are not sure what server is hosting your MySQL database, contact your server administrator to get that information.
</ul>
